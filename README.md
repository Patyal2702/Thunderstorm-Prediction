# Thunderstorm-prediction Using Machine Learning
Thunderstorms can have significant impacts on society, including 
causing damage to infrastructure, disrupting transportation, and posing 
risks to human safety. Accurate prediction of thunderstorm occurrences 
and intensities is therefore important for mitigating these impacts. In 
this project, we propose a machine learning approach for predicting 
thunderstorms using meteorological data.
Our method involves collecting meteorological data from various 
sources, including Government of Jharkhand. We then preprocess and 
clean the data, and apply various machine learning algorithms to build 
prediction models. We evaluate the performance of our modelâ€™s using 
evaluation of many metrics and compare the results to baseline models.
Our results show that our machine learning approach is able to 
accurately predict thunderstorms improvement over the baseline 
models. We also identify important factors that contribute to the 
prediction accuracy and discuss potential applications of our approach.
Overall, this project demonstrates the potential of machine learning for 
improving thunderstorm prediction and highlights the importance of 
carefully selecting and processing data for effective model training.
